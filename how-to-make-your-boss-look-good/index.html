<p>The more effort that you put into helping your boss reputation or standing, the more that it helps you in the long run. So how can you make your boss look great and also help yourself in the process? It involves hard work, but also a willingness to lead them to some winning solutions too.</p><h2>What Makes Your Boss Look Good Makes You Look Good Too</h2><p>Many people wrongfully think that being successful at work is all about creating their own winning reputation. While you do want to put in time to build your network and create a good reputation for yourself, it’s about more than just that. When you can also successfully make your boss look good, then you are setting yourself up for some great things in the long run.</p><p>You might think that your boss doesn’t appreciate or even care about what you do to help them. Even the most difficult boss needs positive reinforcement from their employees. True leaders know that getting respect from the people that they manage matters greatly. When you do something to make your boss look good, it will go appreciated. It will also help you to stand out as a dedicated employee and helps your boss to know that they can depend on you.</p><p>Keep in mind that the things you do to make your boss look good usually benefit your whole group as well. It may be solving a problem, coming up with a winning idea, or working effectively with other groups—whatever you do to be good at your job will help your boss and your team to shine! That’s good for everyone and these are the types of things that get noticed by the company as a whole.</p><p>Your hard work and efforts won’t go unnoticed, and your boss won’t soon forget it. You want to be sure that you think these efforts through, but if it contributes to the big picture then you can’t go wrong. You look good, your boss looks good, and this is a positive reflection on your group as a whole—that’s what you call a winning combination!</p><h2>You Are Creating a Winning Combination and A Great Long Term Relationship</h2><p>Any good leader knows that they are only as good as their workers. When you shine as an employee they see that you care about the overall group, and they learn very quickly that they can count on you. It’s always important that you never compromise your own principles, but solving problems or helping your group to succeed will make a dramatic impact.</p><p>It need not be anything elaborate, but simply being mindful of your boss presence is what it’s all about. Here are some things to keep in mind which will ensure that your boss looks great, and you are a shining star in the process.</p><p><b>Come up with great ideas and somehow make them theirs. </b>Though you certainly want to be sure that you are productive and effective at your job, you also want to boost your boss reputation in all of this. Come up with ideas and share them with your boss so they can make them their own in a manner of speaking.</p><p>Do your part to show them that you care by leading them to great solutions, and they will be forever grateful. Though you don’t want to give them all the credit, gestures like this go a long way in making your boss look good and also being recognized as a valuable employee in the process.</p><p><b>Be a shining star so that it reflects favorably on your boss. </b>The better that you are at your job, the more that this benefits your boss. Take the time to build important relationships. Do a great job with your work and go above and beyond.</p><p>Yes this benefits you, but it also shows the company that your team works well together. It shows that your boss has great leadership skills when they have an exemplary employee on their team. You might think of this as just doing your job, but it creates a winning bond with your boss and puts your team on the map.</p><p><b>Keep up with constant communication. </b>Be sure to keep your boss apprised of what’s going on and what you’re doing throughout your workday. Nobody likes surprises and in this instance, constant communication can really help you to build trust with your boss.</p><p>It shows that you work as a cohesive unit, and it may also help you if you run into obstacles too. The more that you communicate, the more it keeps your boss in the loop, and the more that you build a sense of team—your boss comes out looking great and you have somebody to go to when the need arises.</p><p><b>Know the priorities and work through them for this benefits both of you. </b>It’s always important to know what the priorities are for your team or group in general. This shows that you are paying close attention to your job responsibilities, but it also ties into you’re the success of your boss overall too. It may be that you set goals together at the beginning of the year.</p><p>It may be that you know what your group is responsible for and you are very aware of the prioritization that goes into making things happen. You want to be sure that you are always looking at your group as a unit, and that your work and the way that you do it helps the overall performance. This is not an individual type of activity, for the more time that you put into knowing what your group should be focused on the better.</p><p><b><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/05/14/how-to-make-the-boss-look-good-without-compromising-your-principles/2/#65faf5e44f9e"></a></b></p><p>Though you might think that it only matters what others think of you in the workplace, it’s much more than that. If you can make yourself look good while also making your boss look good, then you’ve created a winning situation. Anything you can do to boost their reputation only helps you in the long run—so the time and effort that you put in will help tremendously in your career growth and also create a good relationship moving forward.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="13"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="14"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="15"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="16"><span data-reactid="17"><!-- react-empty: 18 --><h2 data-reactid="19"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="20">How To Make Your Boss Look Good</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="23"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
